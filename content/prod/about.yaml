    - 
      paragraph: "The Molecular Targets Platform is part of NCI’s $$[Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI)](target:[_blank] url:[https://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/childhood/childhood-cancer-data-initiative])$$ which is building a community centered around childhood cancer care and research data. Through enhanced data sharing, we can improve our understanding of cancer biology to improve preventive measures, treatment, quality of life, and survivorship, as well as ensure that researchers learn from every child with cancer. CCDI will help speed progress for children and adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with childhood cancer and their families.  $$[Sign-up for email updates from NCI](target:[_blank] url:[https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNIHNCI/subscriber/new?topic_id=USNIHNCI_223])$$"

      paragraph: "$$*Molecular Targets Platform Overview*$$" 
    -
      paragraph: "The Molecular Targets Platform is a National Cancer Institute (NCI) instance of the $$[Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/)$$ with a focus on pediatric cancer data. This tool allows users to browse and identify associations between molecular targets, diseases, and drugs. The Molecular Targets Platform builds upon the data and functionality of the Open Targets Platform while also including: [needs list] The FDA Pediatric Molecular Target Lists (FDA PMTL); Analyses of pediatric oncology datasets from the Open Pediatric Cancer (OpenPedCan) project at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia:; Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET); Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA); Gabriella Miller Kids First Neuroblastoma (Kids First). As the project matures, new pediatric cancer data and additional functionality will be added to the Molecular Targets Platform."

      paragraph: "$$*Open Targets Platform*$$"
    - 
      paragraph: "The Open Targets Platform is the open-source infrastructure upon which the Molecular Targets Platform is built."
    -
      paragraph: "The Open Targets Platform is a comprehensive tool that supports systematic identification and prioritisation of potential therapeutic drug targets. By integrating publicly available datasets including data generated by the Open Targets consortium, the Platform builds and scores target-disease associations to assist in drug target identification and prioritisation. It also integrates relevant annotation information about targets, diseases, phenotypes, and drugs, as well as their most relevant relationships."
    -
      paragraph: "The Open Targets Platform is not an NCI program; their site is not affiliated with the NCI or any other US government agency. However, the Open Targets Platform is an open-source product, meaning that the data and code are shared freely with other organizations for development. The NCI has added pediatric cancer data and additional functionality into a separate instance of the Open Targets Platform under NCI control – the Molecular Targets Platform."
    -
      paragraph: "This About page will document all of the new data and features present in the Molecular Targets Platform. For detailed descriptions and tutorials of the built-in functions of the Open Targets Platform, please see their documentation [EXTERNAL] or their most recent publication: [needs indent] Ochoa, D. et al. (2021). Open Targets Platform: supporting systematic drug–target identification and prioritisation [EXTERNAL]. Nucleic Acids Research."

      paragraph: "$$*FDA Pediatric Molecular Target Lists (FDA PMTL)*$$"
    - 
      paragraph: "In accordance with the Race to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act, the FDA and NCI generated two lists: one list of molecular targets relevant to the growth of pediatric cancers and one list of molecular targets not relevant to the growth of pediatric cancers. The Molecular Targets Platform integrates a computable interpretation of these lists in order to better inform decisions and improve treatments for childhood cancers."

    -
      paragraph: "The data within the OpenPedCan Somatic Mutations display is derived from several source datasets, also known as cohorts. Each frequency is calculated and displayed for each dataset. Some Target-Disease combinations are present in more than one dataset; these also have a frequency calculation across all datasets and are noted as “All Cohorts"."
