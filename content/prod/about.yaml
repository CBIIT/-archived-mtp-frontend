      paragraph: "The Molecular Targets Platform is part of NCI’s $$[Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI)](target:_blank url:https://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/childhood/childhood-cancer-data-initiative type:0)$$, which is building a community centered around childhood cancer care and research data. Through enhanced data sharing, we can improve understanding of cancer biology,  preventive measures, treatment, quality of life, and survivorship, as well as ensure that researchers learn from every child with cancer. $$[Sign-up for email updates from NCI](target:_blank url:https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNIHNCI/subscriber/new?topic_id=USNIHNCI_223 type:0)$$."

      paragraph: "The Molecular Targets Platform is a National Cancer Institute (NCI) instance of the $$[Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/)$$ with a focus on pediatric cancer data. This tool allows users to browse and identify associations between $$*molecular targets, diseases*$$, and $$*drugs*$$. The Molecular Targets Platform builds upon the data and functionality of the Open Targets Platform while also including:"

    -
      paragraph: "The $$[Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/)$$ is the open-source infrastructure upon which the Molecular Targets Platform is built."
    -
      paragraph: "As described by Open Targets: 'The Open Targets Platform is a comprehensive tool that supports systematic identification and prioritisation of potential therapeutic drug targets. By integrating publicly available datasets including data generated by the Open Targets consortium, the Platform builds and scores target-disease associations to assist in drug target identification and prioritisation. It also integrates relevant annotation information about targets, diseases, phenotypes, and drugs, as well as their most relevant relationships.' "
    - 
      paragraph: "The Open Targets Platform is not an NCI program; their site is not affiliated with the NCI or any other US government agency. However, the Open Targets Platform is an open-source product, meaning that the data and code are shared freely with other organizations for development. The NCI has added pediatric cancer data and additional functionality into a separate instance of the Open Targets Platform under NCI control – the Molecular Targets Platform."
    -
      paragraph: "This About page will document all of the new data and features present in the Molecular Targets Platform. For detailed descriptions and tutorials of the built-in functions of the Open Targets Platform, please see their $$[documentation](https://platform-docs.opentargets.org/)$$ or their most recent publication:"

The Molecular Targets Platform integrates a computable interpretation of these lists to better inform decisions and improve treatments for childhood cancers."
